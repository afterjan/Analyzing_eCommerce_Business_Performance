<div align = 'justify'>
â€œIn a company, measuring business performance is very important to track, monitor, and assess the success or failure of various business processes. Therefore, this paper will analyze business performance for an eCommerce company, taking into account several business metrics such as customer growth, product quality, and payment types."

**Tools**: PostgreSQL

## **Data Preparation**
Before analyzing, here are the steps I did during the data preprocessing stage:

- Create workspace: database and table
- Import data: 8 tables
- Build ERD

## **Business Metrics**

- Annual Customer Activity Growth Analysis
- Annual Product Category Quality Analysis
- Analysis of Annual Payment Type Usage

## **Analysis/Insight**
<div align = 'justify'>

- The number of Monthly Active User (MAU) have positive growth. This situation needs to be maintained by increasing brand awareness to providing promos for new customers.

- The number of new customers has positive growth, but unfortunately the trend of customers making repeated transactions is not good, most of the customers only order once throughout the year.

- The company has good growth seen from the number of annual revenues which have continued to increase over the last 3 years.

- From year to year the best-selling and the most cancellations products always change every year.

- The most used payment method is credit card. Further analysis can be carried out by confirming with other departments, for example Marketing or Business Development regarding this matter.
